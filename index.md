  - **Twitter Analytics Project** – _Built end-to-end infrastructure for extracting analytics information from compressed raw Twitter data larger than 1TB in size. Used Amazon Elastic MapReduce for extracting and transforming data raw data from Amazon S3, which was then stored in MySQL and HBase databases and load tested via multiple web queries of varying complexity via web services built on Undertow and achieved on average throughput of 5,000 PRS and latency of 15 ms.
