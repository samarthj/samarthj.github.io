   _Project Experience:_ All projects were developed using Agile SDLC and was involved in all areas from Requirements Elicitation & Requests for Proposals, to Software Architecture Design to final Software Development and Delivery to the customer.
   
  - **Westpac – Credit Card & Loan Application:** _Did a system overhaul of the existing web portal built on Spring framework and moved to mobile friendly technologies, with a RESTful (Java) backend and AngularJS frontend. Designed the complete Software Architecture of the front-end based on a product line model that supports easy branding changes alongside a responsive web design. Affected several performance optimizations and UX enhancements for smooth application flow across all browsers, including backward compatibility to Internet Explorer 6._
  
  - **Goldman Sachs – Make an Impact:** _Built an Android application designed to aid in the campus recruitment conducted by Goldman Sachs across the globe and to create awareness about the various career paths in the company. Designed the complete Mobile Software Architecture that decouples all content (sourced from Goldman Sachs and their portals on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and LinkedIn) from the UI and can by dynamically updated without requiring an update to the application. Affected several performance optimizations and UX enhancements which impressed the client to ask for similar changes on their iOS application. Received a Bravo Award for Excellence in Feb 2014 for the contributions to this project._
  
  - **C93 – Mobile Virtual Wallet:** _Built concept mobile applications on Android and iOS that provide a complete mobile digital commerce ecosystem solution that includes banking & telephone/online/NFC payment functionalities, complemented with statistical reporting and budget management. Designed the complete Mobile Software Architecture that interfaces with Infosys’ Finacle Digital Commerce (FDC) as the backend. The solution was designed using a product line based architecture, which allows easy changes to branding and quick addition of new services, with several performance optimizations to ensure a viable solution as well as slick interface on both phone and tablet. Being a first of its kind solution in the Australian market, the project has gained immense traction and is being currently developed as a commercial solution for several service providers across many domains. Received a Bravo Award for Excellence in Oct 2013 for the contributions to this project._


## Education Experience

- **Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science, Masters in Sofware Engineering, Aug 2014 - Dec 2015, _CGPA - 3.60_**
  
  _Relevant Courses: Cloud Computing, Architecture for Software Systems, Introduction to Machine Learning, Management of Software Development, Methods: Deciding What to Design, Analysis of Software Artifacts, Software Development Studio_
 
  _Project Experience:_
  
  - **Twitter Analytics Project** – _Built end-to-end infrastructure for extracting analytics information from compressed raw Twitter data larger than 1TB in size. Used Amazon Elastic MapReduce for extracting and transforming data raw data from Amazon S3, which was then stored in MySQL and HBase databases and load tested via multiple web queries of varying complexity via web services built on Undertow and achieved on average throughput of 5,000 PRS and latency of 15 ms. As a result of the performance in the projects in the course was offered a position as Teaching Assistant._
  
  - **Input Text Predictor** – _Built a simple text predictor that analyzes the text from over 6000 books (40GB) of data to build a Bayesian probabilistic model for phrases up to 5 words long. The analytics for the data was done using Amazon Elastic MapReduce with a cost of less than 1USD/hour and the probabilistic model was stored in HDFS using Hive for queries through a web service._
  
  - **Trusted Family’s Data Analytics Portal** – _Built a Data Visualization Framework front-end using EmberJS and an Analytics Engine using Ruby that uses analytics data from Trusted Family’s social platform stored in MongoDB to provide business insights for their account managers and their client’s organizations. Designed the Software System Architecture for the Analytics Engine that allows Trusted Family to modify business rules of the analytics framework on the fly to improve user-facing performance and the ability to modify the analysis pattern in the future. In addition as the Quality Manager and kept the defect density to 11/KSLOC during development with only 1 escaped defect after release._
